# OZZYLANG
A command-line programming language inspired by heavy metal and Ozzy Osbourne. Built with Python, it lets you write .ozzy scripts that  summon chaos and play music in the terminal.

KEYWORDS = [
  'Bless',        # instead of VAR (Ozzy famously bit a bat)

  'AND',        # instead of AND (axe = guitar = joining sound)
  'OR',       # instead of OR (mosh pits are chaotic choices)
  'NOT',     # instead of NOT (negating = rejection = scream)

  'thencry',       # instead of ELIF
  'beware',      # instead of ELSE
